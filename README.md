# Stack-Overflow-Tags-Network-Visualization

Stack Overflow is a free resource and we have relied on it often for coding problems in school and work. This is why we want to understand Stack Overflowâ€™s tagging structure. 

## Objective
To understand which tags are highly associated and used /appear together in the stack platform and identify trending technologies and techniques used in industry based on tags.

## Dataset
Worked on the dataset provided by stack overflow team on Kaggle. It contains nodes and links and other additional information.

## Approach
Experimented with network measures like connectivity, centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness), clustering etc. to analyze the network and association of the tags, and visualized the network using Fruchterman Reingold, Reingold Tilford layout algorithms.
Implemented community detection algorithms like walk trap and label propagation algorithms to identify the communities and understand neighborhoods.
